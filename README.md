# py-nasolaringoscopia

## Objective

 This code is in development and, so far, is capable just read video in the directory `input` to extract its frames 
 storing them in directory `output`.

## Genaral instructions

 To be able to recreate the environment used to development this solution, open the file [env.txt](env.txt) and read it.

 This project contain 2 (two) principals directories. In `src`, you will find all source code executable through  
 `main.py`. And in `input`, you will have a directory specifically designated to store the input videos. The only one 
 condition to use this directory is the appropriate use of point in the files' names. There is sample video in `input` 
 so that you test your code or delete it to add others.
